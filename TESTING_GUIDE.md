## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set"**
   - Solution: Set DATABASE_URL in Vercel environment variables

2. **"Authentication required. Please log in again"**
   - Solution: JWT token expired, user needs to log in again

3. **Auto-save not working**
   - Check: User is logged in
   - Verify: Auto-save is enabled in character management
   - Check: Network connectivity

4. **Character data not loading**
   - Check: Database connection test passes
   - Verify: Character exists in user's account
   - Test: Manual refresh of character list

5. **Database tests failing**
   - Check: Neon database is accessible
   - Verify: Database schema is up to date
   - Test: Individual API endpoints

### Debug Information

Access debug info in browser console:
```javascript
// Check authentication status
console.log('Logged in:', zeviAPI.isLoggedIn());

// Check current user
console.log('Current user:', localStorage.getItem('zevi-current-user'));

// Test API connectivity
zeviAPI.getCharacters()
  .then(data => console.log('Characters:', data))
  .catch(err => console.error('API Error:', err));

// Check application state
console.log('App status:', app.getVersion());

// Test database
runDatabaseTests();
```
